# Google-Calendar-to-CSV

A neat little wrapper over [icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) to extract structured data from an .ics data dump and write the text to .txts or a combined .csv

Fields are:
* Event Name
* Description
* Location
* Duration
* Start Time
* Finish Time

## Usage

```py
pip install icalendar
python3 convert_ics_to_csv.py
```
